Thank you for checking out my Find an Anime API!

This API allows the user to search for the name of an anime. When searching two things will happen.

Firstly, when an Anime is searched: On the left side thumbnails of the Anime will appear. When the user clicks these thumbnails they will open a tab to that respective animes ' MyAnimeList' page which contains a description, air date, languages, ect. 

While searching, the typed in anime will be saved as a user history button that when the user returns they may click the name of the anime and search for it again. 

Secondly, when an Anime is searched: On the right side, a youtube video will appear in relation to the animes introduction so the user may watch the opening to see the animation.


#####  All of the code written to create this API was made in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

 #####  The Languages used were HTML, CSS, and Javascript with JQuery.
